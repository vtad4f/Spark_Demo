The regex pattern is generic, so that if the pages are something other than P[0-9]+
   it will still work.
   
In the map phase we find all the pages in the row. We calculate the page rank for the
   first page. Then we set a value of 1 for inlinks for all proceeding pages. All of which
   are returned and then interpreted as individual items by calling flatMap.
   
In the reduce phase we just add the array elements together. Only the array values are
   considered (i.e. not the page strings) because we call reduceByKey.
   
Then we convert the arrays to strings via the format function. In addition to aligning the
   values it restricts float values to 2 decimal places. The alignment is important, because
   it allows us to utilize the bash sort command and not rely on scala.
   
I went ahead and also restricted the output to 10 entries for a convenient screenshot.
